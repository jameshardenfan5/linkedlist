Worshippers had filtered into a mosque in northeastern Nigeria on Tuesday, mingling as morning prayers were just getting underway, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in midst of crowd. The blast in town of Mubi was devastating, killing at least 50 people and leaving many others injured, according to local police.

"The roof was blown off," one witness, who lives nearby house of worship, told news service Agence France-Presse. "People near mosque said prayer was midway when bomber, who was obviously in congregation, detonated his explosives."

There was no immediate claim of responsibility â€” though it was immediately clear who authorities believe might have been behind attack: Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group that grew out of nearby Borno state.

Boko Haram's jihadi fighters have been blamed for deaths of roughly 20,000 people and displacement of more than 2.6 million others in less than a decade. Just last week, group was blamed for killing 14 people in Borno state capital, Maiduguri, in what The Associated Press called "one of largest such attacks in city in years."

"We all know trend," police spokesman Othman Abubakar told AFP. "We don't suspect anyone specifically but we know those behind such kind of attacks."
