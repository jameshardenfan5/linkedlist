Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has resigned from office, according to the speaker of the country's parliament. Midway through proceedings to impeach the president Tuesday, Speaker Jacob Mudenda read what he said was Mugabe's letter of resignation as the body of lawmakers erupted in jubilant applause.

The resignation, which ends the tenure of one of the world's longest-ruling leaders, comes just one day after Mugabe, 93, ignored a deadline set by his own party to step down — it follows a week in which Mugabe had been under house arrest by the military, which had seized power in what it described as a "bloodless correction."


The apparent relief of many Zimbabweans caps six days of uncertainty in the country, in which Mugabe heard — largely ignored — calls for his resignation from his own ruling ZANU-PF party demonstrators in the streets.

Then, the capper: On Sunday, even Mugabe's own ZANU-PF party voted to remove him his wife, Grace, appoint the recently ousted vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the head of the party in his stead. That's when the party issued its ultimatum: Step down, or you will be impeached.

Mugabe's critics are "saying that Mugabe has brought economic despondency," NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton told Morning Edition, "and also that he has allowed his wife, the first lady Grace Mugabe — who has unbridled political ambition wanted to become vice president, we are told, that is why he sacked one of his vice presidents — that he has allowed his wife to usurp power."
