That's a slight uptick from a year ago, when a CNN poll found that 53 percent said were dreading having to carry on such a conversation, with 43 percent saying looked forward to such a dialogue.
"There's a sense of dread. It suggests some indigestion may be part of Thanksgiving dinner if politics come up," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. "People you work with and go out with socially tend to share political views, but when you get to family, if politics is in the recipe, it may not taste very well."

That trepidation about broaching politics isn't coming from just one political party, but almost two-thirds of Democrats said are, while only about half of Republicans were. (Fifty-six percent of independents also said so.)

President Trump is, unsurprisingly, a polarizing topic of potential dinner conversation. Forty-seven percent of people in the poll said find it "stressful and frustrating" when talking with people who have a different opinion about the president than do. (A Pew Research poll from June found 59 percent saying the same thing.)
