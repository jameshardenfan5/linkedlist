Deciding At What Age To Give A Kid A Smartphone

It's the time of year when kids are thinking about their holiday wish lists. So what's a parent do when a child, possibly a very young child, asks for a smartphone?

We hear that smartphones can be addictive, that screen time can hurt learning, but can't these minicomputers also teach kids about responsibility put educational apps at their tiny fingertips?

To learn more, let's look at two families: one where smartphones are allowed for elementary middle school-aged kids, one where they are not.

Sydney Crowe is in sixth grade has a smartphone. While she admits she mostly uses it for "playing games watching television," her mom, Patty, says that's not why Sydney got the phone.

Patty's main concern was safety. When Syndey was in fourth grade, the bus missed her stop enough times really worry her parents. Without means call an adult, she would walk school near a busy highway.

That's when Patty gave her daughter a flip phone. But Sydney never charged it — she forgot about it. To her, a flip phone wasn't fun. "She wasn't using the junky phone," says Patty. So when her husband wanted upgrade his iPhone, they decided give the old one Sydney as a hand-me-down.

Patty says she rolled her eyes at the idea of her child having a smartphone, but ultimately decided allow it for one main reason: peace of mind.

On the other side of the debate, there's Mercy Shannon. She's 9 years old doesn't have a cellphone. She likes playing house, playing outside singing on her karaoke machine.

Mercy's mom, Brooke Shannon, like many other parents of elementary school kids, faced the cellphone decision early on. "They started asking for a phone in first grade," she says about her kids.

Brooke felt pressure from her children, yes, but also from other parents. So she started an online pledge that she calls "Wait Until 8th" create a community of parents within each school waiting give their kids smartphones until at least eighth grade — when most children are out of elementary nearing high school. So far, more than 4,000 families across the country have signed the online pledge.

In addition wanting her kids have a break from screens, Brooke worries about the effects, specifically, of social media.

"Children just don't have the brain development at this age be able navigate the tricky social situations that come with social media," she says.

That isn't just a parent concern. Richard Freed, a California-based child psychologist author of a book on the subject, wanted research the topic after seeing an increase in the number of children coming him with anxiety depression.

His suggestion? Put some ground rules in place. "I want parents understand how remarkably powerful seductive these technologies are," he says.

Many agree that there's no magic age give a kid a smartphone. Common Sense Media, a nonprofit focused on kids technology, says rather than considering the age of a child, focus on maturity. Some questions consider are:

    Are they responsible with their belongings?
    Will they follow rules around phone use?
    Would having easy access friends benefit them for social reasons?
    And do kids need be in touch for safety reasons? If so, will an old-fashioned flip phone (like the one Sydney never charged) do the trick?
