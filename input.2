Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has resigned from office, according to the speaker of the country's parliament. Midway through proceedings to impeach the president Tuesday, Speaker Jacob Mudenda read what he said was Mugabe's letter of resignation as the body of lawmakers erupted in jubilant applause.

The resignation, which ends the tenure of one of the world's longest-ruling leaders, comes just one day after Mugabe, 93, ignored a deadline set by his own party to step down — and it follows a week in which Mugabe had been under house arrest by the military, which had seized power in what it described as a "bloodless correction."

Crowds greeted the news Tuesday with celebrations and shouts of joy in the streets of the capital, Harare. Those celebrations were mirrored inside the parliament building, where politicians also loosed a raucous round of cheers.

The apparent relief of many Zimbabweans caps six days of uncertainty in the country, in which Mugabe heard — and largely ignored — calls for his resignation from his own ruling ZANU-PF party and demonstrators in the streets.

Then, the capper: On Sunday, even Mugabe's own ZANU-PF party voted to remove him and his wife, Grace, and appoint the recently ousted vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, as the head of the party in his stead. That's when the party issued its ultimatum: Step down, or you will be impeached.

Mugabe's critics are "saying that Mugabe has brought economic despondency," NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton told Morning Edition, "and also that he has allowed his wife, the first lady Grace Mugabe — who has unbridled political ambition and wanted to become vice president, we are told, and that is why he sacked one of his vice presidents — that he has allowed his wife to usurp power."
